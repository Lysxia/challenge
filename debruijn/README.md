# Strongly-typed System F in GHC

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to define a strongly-typed term representation for System F terms in GHC using the singletons library.

The explanation is accompanied by the fully worked out example code in the github repository.

*Why strongly-typed ASTs?*
With a strongly-typed term representation, only well-typed terms can be constructed. Language tools that manipulate such data structures can be sure that certain invariants â‰¥are maintained by the system. For example, the definition of capture-avoiding substitution can be difficult to get correct from scratch. By working with a typed representation, we can be sure that there are no scope-errors in our interpreters, compilers and optimizers and that our transformations are type preserving.

*Disclaimer*: there is a long-standing discussion in the Haskell community about the use of fancy types in industrial-strength libraries. This project does not describe an industrial use of Haskell so does not add *anything* to that discussion. Indeed, it's not at all clear that you would want to use this approach in your compiler for your polymorphic language. Although variable binding is difficult to get right, there are already tools, such as [Unbound](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unbound) and [Bound](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bound), that can help you develop a correct implementation of binding.

So why do I care about this topic? First, I've wanted to have deeper understanding of de Bruijn representations for some time now and working with strongly-typed versions forces me to look closer at what is actually going on. Second, I'd also like explore (and demonstrate) the state of the art in dependently-typed programming in Haskell, especially with the assistance of the [singletons](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) library. But, most importantly, I find puzzles like this one fun to think about, and we all need a little more fun in these times.

## Table of Contents

- [Part I: Representing binding and substitution using de Bruijn indices](debruijn1.md)

*Reference files:* [Subst](src/Subst.hs) and [Simple](src/Simple.hs)

The first part is a tutorial overview of de Bruijn indices and substitution, culminating in an traditionally typed implementation of the simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC). If you are new to using de Bruijn indices, this part will walk you through the details and provide a general purpose recipe for a Haskell implementation of binding.  Even if you are not new to de Bruijn indices, you should take a look at this implementation because there are *different* versions of substitution with this representation.

- [Part II: Adding strong types to STLC](debruijn2.md)

*Reference files:* [SubstTyped](src/SubstTyped.hs) and [SimpleTyped](src/SimpleTyped.hs).

Next, we show how to add type indices to the ASTs developed in the previous section to constrain the representation to only well-typed terms of STLC. None of the code changes in this part, just the types.

- Part IIa: Optimized de Bruijn representation  (*Optional part, may be skipped*)

*Reference files:* [SubstTypedOpt](src/SubstTypedOpt.hs) and [SimpleTypedOpt](src/SimpleTypedOpt.hs).

Simple definitions of substitution for de Bruijn indices can be woefully inefficient. In this file we show how to rectify that by the introduction of delayed substitutions at binders. This optimization can even be hidden behind an abstract type for binders. Furthermore, the type indices developed in Part II show that the optimization is still type preserving.

- [Part III: Untyped ASTs for System F](debruijn3.md)

*Reference file:* [Poly](src/Poly.hs).

Using the substitution infrastructure developed in Part I, we extend our implementation of STLC to System F.

- [Part IV: Strongly-typed AST for System F](debruijn4.md)

*Reference file:* [PolyTyped](src/PolyTyped.hs) and [SubstProperties](src/SubstProperties.hs).

Finally, we make a well-typed AST for System F, using both the untyped (for System F types) and typed (for System F terms) substitution infrastructures.

- Part IVa: Optimized de Bruijn representation

*Reference file:* [PolyTypedOpt](src/PolyTypedOpt.hs).

And, it is straightforward to convert the well-typed version from part IV to use the optimized substitution library.
